Building a Large Language Model from scratch - documented daily learning journey

# Building a Large Language Model from scratch
*A complete journey from zero to LLM, documented daily on Mac M3 Pro*

## The Mission 
Build and train a GPT - style language model from scratch to deeply understand how LLMs work.
No black boxes , no shortcuts - just pure understanding through implementation.

## Who AM I ?
A developer with basic ML knowledge embarking on the ambitious journey to understand LLMs by building one from first principles

## The Journey
**Start Date:** 24th May 2025
**Target Completion:** 21 Weeks
**Daily Commitment:** 3-4 hours

## The Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Foundations** (Weeks 1-6) - NLP fundamentals & Transformer architecture
- **Phase 2: Implementation** (Weeks 7-10) - Building the complete model
- **Phase 3: Training** (Weeks 11-14) - Training on real datasets  
- **Phase 4: Optimization** (Weeks 15-16) - Performance & deployment

## Live Progress
**Current Focus:** Understanding what LLMs actually do  
**Days Completed:** 0/112  
**Latest Achievement:** Setting up for the journey!  

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Mac M3 Pro (proving you don't need a supercomputer!)
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** PyTorch (minimal usage - building from scratch)
- **Philosophy:** Understand first, optimize later

## Learning Approach
1. **Learn in Public** - Every day documented
2. **Code Everything** - Implement before using libraries  
3. **Explain Simply** - If I can't explain it, I don't understand it
4. **Fail Forward** - Document mistakes and learnings
